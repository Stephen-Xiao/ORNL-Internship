# ALchemy
ALchemy /ˈæl.kə.mi/ (noun): a process so effective that it seems like magic.

ALchemy is a package for active learning built with experimentalists in physics, chemistry, and materials science in mind.
The goal is to provide one interface for calculating various surrogate models (from various packages) and acquisition functions with as little 
code as possible to lower the barrier to adopt modern AI-driven experimentation practices.
